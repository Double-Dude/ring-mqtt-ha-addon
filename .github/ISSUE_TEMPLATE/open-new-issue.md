### PLEASE READ THIS FIRST ###
This page is for reporting issues related to the Ring Devices for Home Assistant addon.  This addon is just a wrapper for ring-mqtt designed to make it easier for Home Assistant users to use the ring-mqtt script.  Most issues should not be opened here but rather reported directly to the [ring-mqtt project page](https://github.com/tsightler/ring-mqtt).  Only open an issue here if you are experiencing a problem with installing or configuring the addon itself.

**Describe the bug**
A clear and concise description of what the bug is.  Please enter a brief summary of the issue in the title above as well.

**Debug Logs**
To effectively troubleshoot the issue logs will generally be required.  If your error is shown in the Hass.io addon logs window, feel free to simply copy it here, however, this window only shows the last 60-70 lines and sometimes the error will not be shown in it's entirety or even at all.  Hass.io makes it difficult, but I have written up a process to [get full logs](https://github.com/tsightler/ring-mqtt-hassio-addon/blob/master/GET-LOGS.md) from the plugin.  When possible, please do this when submitting a bug report.
