## v4.6.2
 - Version bump to pull in changes required to fix 404 errors on startup due to Ring API changes
 
## v4.6.1
 - Add code to (hopefully) automatically remove legacy light based volume controls from Home Assistant

## v4.6.0
 - Adapt fan component to new fan schema introduced in Home Assistant 2021.3.  This schema is based on percentage vs using three preset speeds.  Presets for "low, medium, high" will still work but it's now possible to use the new percent based speed topics which map directly to Ring app and Home Assistant.  This is especially useful for fans which support more than 3 speeds.
 - Add support to define the default "on" duraton for Ring Smart Lighting via config option beam_duration (or BEAMDURATION envionment variable), please refer to documation (DOCS.md) for more details
 - Add ability to override "on" duration for individual Ring Smart Lights via MQTT topic, also uses number integraiton to present in Home Assistant for easy access via Lovalace UI or automations
 - Add support for "arming" state during exit delay
 - Add support for configuring a disarm code for Home Assistant (See disarm_code option in README)
 - Add support for reporting basic status and attributes of Ring External Siren
 - Docker images now enable debug logging by default (was already true of addon)
 - Removed "enable_volume" config option since the new number based integration will no longer be accidentally triggered by light based automations
 
 **Breaking Changes**
 - Fan automations in Home Assistant should continue to work with backwards compatibility, however, it's probably a good idea to update any automations to use the new methods (see Fan section of [Breaking Changes](https://www.home-assistant.io/blog/2021/03/03/release-20213/#breaking-changes) in Home Assistant 2021.3 release notes) and to review the new percent based speed settings as well.
 - Volume controls now use Home Assistant number component instead of the previously used light component.  Any automations for volume changes will need to be updated to use the new component.

## v4.5.7
 - Switch to custom ring-client-api with fix for hang during network/service outages
 - Add MotionDetectionEnabled attribute to camera motion entity attributes
 - Add support for snapshot interval setting via Home Assitant number entity

## v4.5.6 (***This build was experiemental and never intended for release***)
 - Experimental release with custom ring-client-api

## v4.5.5
 - Improve stream reliability with new Ring media servers by bumping to ring-client-api 9.18.0

## v4.5.4
 - New, lightweight, hopefully improved, snapshot from live stream implementation for battery cameras
 - Send "online" status prior to sending state data updates
 - Bump dependencies

## v4.5.3
 - Implement reconnect improvements for cameras after lost connections
 - Bump ring-client-api version

## v4.5.2
- Second attempt to fix truncation of video length (tries to read property if available, otherwise keeps stream alive for 60 seconds)

## v4.5.1
- When attempting to grab snapshot from livestream for battery cameras, set stream duration equal to video recording length setting to (hopefully) avoid truncating video recording

## v4.5.0
 - Snapshot on motion reliability improvements for line powered cameras
 - Snapshot on motion attempts to grab image from livestream for battery powered cameras.  This is slower, less reliable and sometimes produces lower quality images vs snapshots, but as battery cameras don't allow snapshots wile streaming, it's the only option for getting a snapshot of a motion event
 - Person detect attribute for camera motion events (needs testing, only works if person detection is enable on accout and show up as person detect events in history)
 - Date/Time uses standard format accross all attributes
 - Retrofit zones are now included as bypass eligible sensors when bypass arming is enabled
 - Docker image updated to Node v14 to hopefully address reconnect issues
 - Fix various crash bugs in camera support## v4.4.0
 - Add Arming Bypass Mode switch
 - Misc code cleanups and improvements
 - Drop support for i386 architecture for addon

## v4.4.0
 - Add Arming Bypass Mode switch
 - Misc code cleanups and improvements

## v4.3.2
 - Change enable_snapshots config option to snapshot_mode (fix for addon upgrade issue)

## v4.3.1
 - Add support for scheduled snapshot updates (see docs for details)
 
## v4.3.0
- Add support for sending snapshot images on camera motion events (must be explicitly enabled)
 
## v4.2.2
- Bump dependencies to latest versions
- Rebuild Docker image with latest base to pull in latest node v12 version (12.20.1)

## v4.2.1
- Add tilt sensor support (Garage Doors)
- Fix range extender device name
- Minor doc updates

## v4.2.0
- Add support for Zwave Range Extender info sensor data (thanks to @alexanv1)
- Make volume control support configurable
- Monitor legacy hass/status stopic for Home Assistant restarts
- Documentation updates and cleanups

## v4.1.1
- Fix enabling panic buttons for Docker
- Fix branch feature when running Docker as unprivileged user

## v4.1.0
- New Feature: Branches
  Simple testing of latest git repo versions from master or dev branch without updating addon.
- Use common image for addon and standalone Docker users
- Reduced Docker image size by ~65MB
- Fix issue with Docker image not being cleaned during upgrades/uninstall (unfortunately won't help for existing images, suggest existing users run "docker system prune" to remove old images)
- Web tweaks to work reasonably with both dark/light themes
- Minor fix for CO sensor to report correct manufacturer

## v4.0.4
- Minor fixes for smart lighting support
- Fix (hopefully) non-fatal resubscribe errors
- Fix a few typos in various devices
- Bump MQTT dependency to 4.2.1

## v4.0.3
- Fix for Smart Lighting motion sensor discovery bug introduced in 4.0

## v4.0.2
- Additional volume control fixes for base station and keypad
- Volume controls show up as lights due to limitations of MQTT component available but you change icons and labels in frontend.

## v4.0.1
- Fixes for various MQTT discovery issues
- Reintroduce manual options for MQTT broker settings (override automatic discovery)
- Minor fixes for Base Station volume and info sensor and Keypad volume

## v4.0.0
- Support for Home Assistant Device Registry
- Each device has an "info" sensor updated at least every 5 minutes. State is JSON data with values unique to each device type (battery level, tamper status, AC state, wireless strength, firmware info, serial number, etc)
- Support for monitoring alarm state
  - "Pending" state is equivalent to "entry delay"
  - "Triggered" state is any alarm
  - Detailed alarm state is available via info sensor
- Support for Fire and Polic Panic Buttons
  - *** Should be Used with Caution *** -- Can trigger alarm events with response
  - Can also be used as a high level monitor for burglar or fire alarms (panic state will trigger based on alarm type)
- Support for Base Station
  - Info sensor for monitoring battery/ac status
  - Ability to set volume (requires use of master account as other accounts don't have permission)
- Support for Keypad
  - Info sensor for monitoring batter/ac status, charging state, etc.
  - Ability to set volume
- Basic support for 3rd party Z-wave contact and motion sensors
  - Assumes device is concact sensor unless device name contains the word "motion"
- Significantly enhanced Web UI for token generation (mostly for Home Assistant Addon)
- Improved debug output with more organized location/device discovery output
- Simplified and standardized location/device handling code (still more work to do but becoming far more maintainable)
